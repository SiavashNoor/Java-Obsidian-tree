## Java Collections
The **Collection in Java** is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects.

Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion.


Java Collection means a single unit of objects. Java Collection framework provides many interfaces (Set, List, Queue, Deque) and classes ([ArrayList](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-arraylist), Vector, [LinkedList](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-linkedlist), [PriorityQueue](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-priorityqueue), HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet).


## List Interface

List interface is the child interface of Collection interface. It inhibits a list type data structure in which we can store the ordered collection of objects. It can have duplicate values.

List interface is implemented by the classes ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, and Stack.
```java
1.  List <data-type> list1= new ArrayList();  
2.  List <data-type> list2 = new LinkedList();  
3.  List <data-type> list3 = new Vector();  
4.  List <data-type> list4 = new Stack();
```

There are various methods in List interface that can be used to insert, delete, and access the elements from the list.



The classes that implement the List interface are given below:::::
- [[ArrayList]]
- [[LinkedList]]
- [[Vector]]
- [[Stack]]
