### Ternary Operator

There is also a short-hand [if else](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_conditions.asp), which is known as the **ternary operator** because it consists of three operands.

It can be used to replace multiple lines of code with a single line, and is most often used to replace simple if else statements:

```java
variable = (condition) ? expressionTrue :  expressionFalse;
```
