The `while` loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is `true`:
```java
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

## The Do/While Loop

The `do/while` loop is a variant of the `while` loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.
```java
do {
  // code block to be executed
}
while (condition);
```
